Introduction:

Examples for using Hogre, Haskell bindings to OGRE
(Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine)
(http://www.ogre3d.org/).

Usage:

1. Install non-Haskell dependencies (OGRE: http://www.ogre3d.org/,
SDL: http://www.libsdl.org/).
2. Install Haskell dependencies (hogre (see 
http://github.com/anttisalonen/hogre), SDL, stm) either using
cabal, by downloading and installing the packages manually.
3. Unpack hogre-examples
4. cabal configure [--user] && cabal build
5. Define the directory where the OGRE plugins are installed in plugins.cfg.
The default is /usr/lib/OGRE.
6. dist/build/example_0[123]/example_0[123]

You need to run all the examples in the directory where the directory Media
is located (root directory of the package), otherwise the content will not 
be found.

Example descriptions:

example_01 creates a simple scene with a moving entity.
It roughly corresponds to OGRE basic tutorial #2 but without input.
If nothing is rendered, try deleting the ogre.cfg file.

example_02 demonstrates use of SDL for input and window creation.
Use arrow keys and page up/down to move, mouse with right mouse button down
to look around and 'q' or escape to exit.

example_03 demonstrates ray scene queries and loading a world configuration 
from a file.
It roughly corresponds to OGRE intermediate tutorial #2.
Use arrow keys and page up/down to move, mouse with right mouse button down
to look around and 'q' or escape to exit. With the left mouse button you can
create some robots on the landscape.
