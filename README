Examples for using Hogre, Haskell bindings to OGRE
(Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine)
(http://www.ogre3d.org/).

You need to run all the examples in the directory where the directory Media
is located, otherwise the content will not be found.

If the OGRE plugins are installed in some other directory than /usr/lib/OGRE, 
you need to define the directory in plugins.cfg.

example_01 creates a simple scene with a moving entity.
It roughly corresponds to OGRE basic tutorial #2 but without input.
If nothing is rendered, try deleting the ogre.cfg file.

example_02 demonstrates use of SDL for input and window creation.
Use arrow keys and page up/down to move, mouse with right mouse button down
to look around and 'q' or escape to exit.

example_03 demonstrates ray scene queries and loading a world configuration 
from a file.
It roughly corresponds to OGRE intermediate tutorial #2.
Use arrow keys and page up/down to move, mouse with right mouse button down
to look around and 'q' or escape to exit. With the left mouse button you can
create some robots on the landscape.
